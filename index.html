  <h1>Who Am I?</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm Andrew.</p>
  <p>I am a tech enthusiast with a passion for science and exploration. Learning and discovering new things is an important part of my daily life.
  
  <br /><br />
  
  I started tinkering with computers as a child, trying to figure out how they were built. 
  As time passed, I developed an interest in computer programming and web development as a passion in my spare time. 
  Countless hours were spent tinkering with lines of codes and resarching how-to's and others code snippets with friends online, 
  primarily working with community forum software to create new designs for both users websites and community board Style Sheets (css).
  It was a fantastic learning experience, and I had a blast solving problems.
  
  <br /><br />
  
  As an adult, I started learning more about the hardware and networking side of the tech world, 
  which eventually led to an interest (and diploma) in computer network administration. 
  Although it was a fantastic experience, it was not the career path that I ended up pursuing. 
  However, I have always maintained my love for computers and coding as my primary passion.

  <div class="container" id="container2">
    <h1>Why i want to Join</h1>

    <p>
      My goal is to take my passion for coding and become a software developer, while leveraging my knowledge of computer hardware and networking to complement my coding skills.
      
      <br /><br />
      
      I believe that GetCoding would be an excellent opportunity for me. Coming from working full-time jobs for the past decade, GetCoding's program offers me the flexibility to dedicate my time off to learning to code and progress through their program at my own pace while still being able to maintain my work and home life. Their program structure is exciting, and I look forward to working with their instructors on future projects.
